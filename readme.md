# iEAT explained
iEAT is interactive Ecological Analysis Tool. The basic aim is to derive fysical characteristics of entities in a waterbody and to derive information on the effects of ecological networks.
This first version is a prototype that gets data from OGC WFS data with physical characteristics (velocity or shearstress) and combines this with data from ecological networks.
